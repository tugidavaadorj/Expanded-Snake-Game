# Expanded-Snake-Game


This snake is the normal Snake game with more modes. 

Different Modes:

Speed: Fast, Medium, Slow

Walls: Walls on, off
-This determines whether the snake will die if it hit outer edge or will loop to the other side

Self-Collision: 
-Pass Through --> The Snake will be able to pass over itself without any consequences
-Death --> The Snake game will end upon self collision
-Cut Tail --> The snake will lose the rest of the body of where it collided

Party Modes:
-Painter: the snake gains size without even having to eat the apple
-Crazy: The snake goes super fast and each apple will make the snake grow much by a lot
-None: the default


Additionally, you can overlap the game modes (i.e. a Fast, walls oFf, Cut Tail, Painter mode.


This project was an excellent practice for my Java. Additionally, I got more exposure to GUI and OOP. 
Additionally, I kind of developed a bad habit of using public static variables (Shhhhhhh). 

**I am going to come back in the future and fix the Buttons so that it will be highlighted when selected

I used Java Game Coding - Basic Snake Game (Eclipse) - MobileiGames on Youtube for the basic game

I used Java game Dev #19 and #20  - Starting Menu & Mouse Input - RealTutsGML for help with the Menu

Everything else, I got through Trial and Error
